Figure out what fuse's lowlevel interface is good for and whether we
should switch to it.

Write multiple filesystems in common blockstore test.

Write two FileSystem objects attached to same fsid test.

Add "snap together" protocol modules concept to wiki.

Figure out the problem w/ matching exception types in python.  Search
for BOGUS in the unit directory ...

Large directories >60 items not implemented.

The "access" call implementation is trivially permissive.  Fix this or
get rid of it ...
