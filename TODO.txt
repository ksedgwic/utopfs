RPM Packaging

  RPM installed utopfs quits after "echo hello > foo"; guessing
  that we are emitting something to stdout?  Investigate ...

Write multiple filesystems in common blockstore test.

Write two FileSystem objects attached to same fsid test.

Add "snap together" protocol modules concept to wiki.

Figure out the problem w/ matching exception types in python.  Search
for BOGUS in the unit directory ...

Large directories >60 items not implemented.

The "access" call implementation is trivially permissive.  Fix this or
get rid of it ...

Figure out the uid an gid, are they in the file_info_t?

  Add tests for mknod based on permissions.

  Add tests for open based on permissions.

Add test for what happens when passwords don't match.

Graphic identity for utopfs?

Check object lifetimes of the python direntry callback objects.
